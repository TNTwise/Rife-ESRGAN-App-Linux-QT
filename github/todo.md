Todo:<br/>
Finish get models function<br/>
Output video extension as input vidoe, fix audio by copying audio from input video to output video as output video processces, or by encoding audio both times (prob shouldnt tbh)<br/>
Add frames to new video output as rendered, and delete rendered frames???(might be a feature in ffmpeg???)<br/>

IMPORTANT<br/>

add vs rife support as it implements better with app<br/>

var cmd = `${inject_env} && "${vspipe}" --arg "tmp=${path.join(cache, "tmp.json")}" -c y4m "${engine}" - -p | "${ffmpeg}" -y -loglevel error -i pipe: ${params} "${tmpOutPath}"`; 

this should help with rife vs support<br/>

implement modular system where app can import modules from scripts(either iterate through module directory or add specific button in settings)<br/>
<br/>
add more AI options<br/>
add tab for upscaling images and not just videos<br/>
add different themes<br/>
add system where you can pause a render, have it save where it took place to a file, and can read that file to resume that render.<br/>
notification to say when render is finished<br/>
generate script based on module for AI(so its easier to implement them)<br/>
fix issue where sometimes realesrgan times is disabled, even on animation(happens for waifu2x too)<br/>
add better downloads that dont rely on github bin dir??, sometimes slow<br/>
run error pop up on original thread<br/>
Add pausing by rendering current frames rendered in optimized preset into a video, and then concating all videos together, and removing all of input_frames / self.times frames. Then re-start rife in the same folder to continue<br/>
add checks periodically in the render to check amount of frames remaining, and if ffmpeg is playing catchup, kill render and render everything out.<br/>
add ifrnet-ncnn-vulkan(seems promising)<br/>
use iteration to iterate through every image and render them individually, may help with pausing(might use rife ncnn vulkan python package to achieve this cleanly?)<br/>
list amount of transitions detected in logs<br/>
fix randomly graying out rife times?<br/>
make it more clear about what the AI being used does<br/>
choose install location<br/>
make full queueing system<br/>
